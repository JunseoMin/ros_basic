@b slam_gmapping is a wrapper around the GMapping SLAM library. It reads laser
scans and odometry and computes a map. This map can be
written to a file using e.g.

  "rosrun map_server map_saver static_map:=dynamic_map"

<hr>

@section topic ROS topics

Subscribes to (name/type):
- @b "scan"/<a href="../../sensor_msgs/html/classstd__msgs_1_1LaserScan.html">sensor_msgs/LaserScan</a> : data from a laser range scanner 
- @b "/tf": odometry from the robot


Publishes to (name/type):
- @b "/tf"/tf/tfMessage: position relative to the map


@section services
 - @b "~dynamic_map" : returns the map


@section parameters ROS parameters

Reads the following parameters from the parameter server

Parameters used by our GMapping wrapper:

- @b "~throttle_scans": @b [int] throw away every nth laser scan
- @b "~base_frame": @b [string] the tf frame_id to use for the robot base pose
- @b "~map_frame": @b [string] the tf frame_id where the robot pose on the map is published
- @b "~odom_frame": @b [string] the tf frame_id from which odometry is read
- @b "~map_update_interval": @b [double] time in seconds between two recalculations of the map


Parameters used by GMapping itself:

Laser Parameters:
- @b "~/maxRange" @b [double] maximum range of the laser scans. Rays beyond this range get discarded completely. (default: maximum laser range minus 1 cm, as received in the the first LaserScan message)
- @b "~/maxUrange" @b [double] maximum range of the laser scanner that is used for map building (default: same as maxRange)
- @b "~/sigma" @b [double] standard deviation for the scan matching process (cell)
- @b "~/kernelSize" @b [int] search window for the scan matching process
- @b "~/lstep" @b [double] initial search step for scan matching (linear)
- @b "~/astep" @b [double] initial search step for scan matching (angular)
- @b "~/iterations" @b [int] number of refinement steps in the scan matching. The final "precision" for the match is lstep*2^(-iterations) or astep*2^(-iterations), respectively.
- @b "~/lsigma" @b [double] standard deviation for the scan matching process (single laser beam)
- @b "~/ogain" @b [double] gain for smoothing the likelihood
- @b "~/lskip" @b [int] take only every (n+1)th laser ray for computing a match (0 = take all rays)
- @b "~/minimumScore" @b [double] minimum score for considering the outcome of the scanmatching good. Can avoid 'jumping' pose estimates in large open spaces when using laser scanners with limited range (e.g. 5m). (0 = default. Scores go up to 600+, try 50 for example when experiencing 'jumping' estimate issues)

Motion Model Parameters (all standard deviations of a gaussian noise model)
- @b "~/srr" @b [double] linear noise component (x and y)
- @b "~/stt" @b [double] angular noise component (theta)
- @b "~/srt" @b [double] linear -> angular noise component
- @b "~/str" @b [double] angular -> linear noise component

Others:
- @b "~/linearUpdate" @b [double] the robot only processes new measurements if the robot has moved at least this many meters
- @b "~/angularUpdate" @b [double] the robot only processes new measurements if the robot has turned at least this many rads

- @b "~/resampleThreshold" @b [double] threshold at which the particles get resampled. Higher means more frequent resampling.
- @b "~/particles" @b [int] (fixed) number of particles. Each particle represents a possible trajectory that the robot has traveled

Likelihood sampling (used in scan matching)
- @b "~/llsamplerange" @b [double] linear range
- @b "~/lasamplerange" @b [double] linear step size
- @b "~/llsamplestep" @b [double] linear range
- @b "~/lasamplestep" @b [double] angular step size

Initial map dimensions and resolution:
- @b "~/xmin" @b [double] minimum x position in the map [m]
- @b "~/ymin" @b [double] minimum y position in the map [m]
- @b "~/xmax" @b [double] maximum x position in the map [m]
- @b "~/ymax" @b [double] maximum y position in the map [m]
- @b "~/delta" @b [double] size of one pixel [m]
